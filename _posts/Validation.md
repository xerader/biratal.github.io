# k-Fold cross validation
## Definition
It's a method that divides the dataset into $k$ folds. A fold is a subset of the dataset that is used during training and testing. 

The model is trained on $k-1$ folds and then tested on the remaining fold. This is repeated $k$ times such that each fold serves as the test set $once$. 

### Advantages
Better for a population test. IT provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the model because it uses all the data points. 

Reduces the variance in outputs, as the results are averaged over $k$ iterations. 

Best when there isn't as much data, as the entire dataset is used. The main **disadvantage** is that it is computationally expensive.
